Title: Operating characteristics plus sample size and local fdr for microarray experiments
Version: 1.9.0
Author: Yudi Pawitan <Yudi.Pawitan@ki.se> and
	Alexander Ploner <Alexander.Ploner@ki.se> 
Description: This package allows to characterize the operating characeristics of
	a microarray experiment, i.e. the trade-off between false discovery rate and
	the power to detect truly regulated genes. The package includes tools both
	for planned experiments (for sample size assessment) and for already
	collected data (identification of differentially expressed genes).
Depends: R (>= 2.1.0), akima, multtest (>= 1.7.3)
