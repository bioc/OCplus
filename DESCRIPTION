Description: This package allows to characterize the operating
        characteristics of a microarray experiment, i.e. the trade-off
        between false discovery rate and the power to detect truly
        regulated genes. The package includes tools both for planned
        experiments (for sample size assessment) and for already
        collected data (identification of differentially expressed
        genes).
Depends: R (>= 2.1.0)
